              The Atmantan cuisine philosophy follows the principles of ‘‘let
              food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food’’ by Hippocrates,
              the Father of Medicine.
            </p>

              Our wellness cuisine is prescriptive in its approach wherein it
              assists the body in restoring health, strength, balance and
              enhancing longevity.
            </p>
            <p class="py-3 text-body-secondary">
              The cuisine here only uses evidence based foods, known for its
              medicinal benefits and the dishes served are nutritious, appealing
              and bursting with colours and energy, to delight your senses,
              while healing your cells.
            </p>
            <p class="py-3 text-body-secondary">
              Atmantan’s gastronomical experience has its roots in age old
              traditions, which maintain and restore health, vitality and
              wellbeing. We recognize the healing power of earth’s medicine in
              the form of plant based ingredients including the healing
              properties of aromatic herbs and spices, and hence only use farm
              fresh plant and seeds produce.
            </p>
            <p class="py-3 text-body-secondary">
              We believe that wholesome, organic, seasonal, local and
              nutritionally dense ingredients are the basic building blocks of
              healthy cuisine. We carefully prepare these ingredients into
              delicious healthy dishes as per Doctors’ prescription and
              individual requirements (allergies etc.). Our own organic farms
              supply to Atmantan’s kitchens as well. The Concept that wellness
              cuisine… nobody does this better than Atmantan!
            </p>
            <p class="py-3 text-body-secondary">
              Dishes that are tastefully plated and nourishing, can be relished
              here as part of the wellness experience of a guest. The eating
              habits encourage mindfulness such that the guest incorporates the
              same into his/her daily schedule when he/she leaves from here.
            </p>

<img src="pageImages/cuisine-img.webp"  class="card-img-top rounded" alt="">
<p  class="py-3 text-body-secondary">The cuisine is simply inspiring and the food here takes in all the nutrients and vitality that nature has to offer. Following the farm-to-table concept, seasonal produce is brought to our kitchens where it is transformed into meals that create lasting impressions. The main idea is that food should therapeutically heal the body, whilst being consumed in tandem with wellness. The Wellness Cuisine here helps keep the body, mind and soul healthy, rejuvenated and positive at all times.</p>

<h2 class="text-center my-5 pt-4">Why Vegetarian Food is Better for Us</h2>
<ul class="px-5">
  <li><p>Pure Vegetarian food is Satvik food which increases our sattva or consciousness.</p></li>
  <li><p>Richest source of all phytonutrients, polyphenols, and antioxidants.</p></li>
  <li><p>Studies show that vegetarians have a longer life expectancy.</p></li>
  <li><p class="pb-5">Vegetarian food is alkaline in nature and hence, highly recommended to treat diseases that originate due to the increased acidic pH of the body.

</h2>
       <ul><li><p class="card-text pb-4 text-body-secondary">We believe that food is one of life’s sustainable pleasures, hence we create dishes that sustain the body whilst delighting the taste buds. We only use natural additives and flavours, such as herbs and spices to enhance our dishes. E.g. We only use pink and rock salts that both add minerals as well as flavour to the food.</p></li> 
       <li><p class="card-text pb-4 text-body-secondary">We use healthy cooking techniques such as braising, steaming, poaching and grilling, while keeping cooking temperatures low, so as to retain as much of the natural flavour and nutrients as possible, whilst ensuring the food is easy to digest.</p></li>
       <li><p class="card-text pb-4 text-body-secondary">We bring in tastes through natural ingredients only. E.g., When a sweet taste is required, we use only natural sweeteners like fruit juice, honey, jaggery or coconut flower syrup. These besides adding the required taste provide so much more in terms of minerals and anti-oxidants, than the empty calories from white sugar.</p></li>
     <li><p class="card-text pb-4 text-body-secondary">We use healthy oils and good fats and whilst these are minimally used in our cooking, when we do use them, we make sure we use only the best.</p></li></ul>
